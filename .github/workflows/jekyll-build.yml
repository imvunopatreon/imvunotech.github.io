          publish_branch: main # The branch where the built site will be pushed
          # if you are deploying to imvunotech.github.io, this should be the 'main' branch
          # If your repo is named USERNAME.github.io, then set publish_branch: main (or master)
          # If your repo is NOT named USERNAME.github.io (it's a project page), then set publish_branch: gh-pages
        # For imvunotech.github.io (User/Organization Page), you should actually publish to 'main'
        # So the publish_branch should be 'main' for your specific use case.
        # However, the setup often creates a 'gh-pages' branch by default, let's clarify that below.
